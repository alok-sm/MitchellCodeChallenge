This is how you would create a new `ComputerController` class:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class ComputerController: CrudControllerBase<ComputerModel>\r\npublic class ComputerModel : CrudModelBase\r\n{\r\n    public string OemName { get; set; }\r\n    public string Model { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Separation of data storage and application\r\nThe challenge asks us to implement an in memory storage but in production application, we would use some sort of a database to store data. Hence, separating the interface and the implementation for the data storage is important\r\n\r\n\r\n### Easy extensibility of the CRUD interfact\r\nThe CRUD interface can easily be extended to incorporate validation, etc. The controller class can override a virtual function on the `CrudControllerBase` class, do the validations and then (optionally) give the base class control to do the remaining job\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic override HttpResponseMessage Post(VehicleModel model)\r\n{\r\n    if(model.Year < 1950 || model.Year > 2050) \r\n    {\r\n        return Request.CreateErrorResponse(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest, \"Year must be between 1950 and 2050\");\r\n    }\r\n    return base.Post(model);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Automated Unit Testing and API endpoint testing\r\n\r\n\r\nThe API is hosted on [http://mitchellchallenge.azurewebsites.net](http://mitchellchallenge.azurewebsites.net).
